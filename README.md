## Robot Gladiators Game

## Page Description
This page hosts a simple javascript robot gladiator game.  The game is initialized upon the page load.  It is written as a simulated code jam, as part of a coding exercise for a web development bootcamp, and the html page is deliberately left empty.  The entire game is played through prompts that load, take user input, and provide feedback.
